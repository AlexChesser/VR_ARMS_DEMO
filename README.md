# VR_ARMS_DEMO
an early of VR arms tracking in unity (2019.3)  with individual finger tracking in Oculus Quest.  Unfortunately I've had to go private with the ongoing work because I'm adding paid assets that aren't redistributable. If you have questions or want help figuring something out in this space, please feel free to reach out via submitting an issue.

Note that there is a forum thread where I talk about the steps used to work with this in a little more detail. 

but this was all YEARS ago and likely is wildly obsolete by now.
